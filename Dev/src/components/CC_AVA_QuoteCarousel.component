            <p>I would probably have no hair or be completely gray if we were not using Avalara AvaTax. There is definite value, because thereâ€™s no way anyone can keep up on the sales tax rules in all of the 46 states that have sales tax and still stay sane.</p>

              <p>The reason you buy Avalara AvaTax is to trust that sales tax is being collected accurately when it needs to be collected, and to not have to look at another sales tax rate again.</p>
